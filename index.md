# Welcome To My Notes

I'm Xuan Khoa Tu Nguyen, a software engineer specialized in web development, here is my notes for
all the knowledge that I have learned so far.


## Motivation

> TLDR: I want to flex my frontend stuffs -_-

*29/08/2024*

Three months ago, my laptop was dead 💀 The last time I used it, I turned it off at midnight;
and since the next morning, it had never been turned on again. Lmao, the power had retired.

That sucks! How about a lot of documents that I stored locally?

> Don't get me wrong; I have backed up all my essential documents on my cloud. I'm just too lazy to
> remember what I'm having in the cloud and what I'm having locally.

So, I want to say goodbye to my data in that laptop formally :)

I borrowed my brother's laptop, temporarily changed the laptop's SSD with my dead laptop's SSD. Voila,
I could see my local data the last time.

When looking through the documents' directory, I found a big vault with more than a hundred
markdown files.

This vault was a result of [a memorable period](https://xuankhoatu.com/blogs/how-did-my-coding-journey-start),
when I had broken through my own limits for a first job as a developer, despite not having the computer
science background.

Although I had synchronized those documents to GitHub, it would be better if I could place them
somewhere more readable. Somewhere I can customize my own styles, easily access them when needed, share with friends, and lightweight.

> Using a CMS platform? Nah, too boring. The customized experience is not for me.
>
> Notion? Too heavy.

Therefore, I came up with an idea of making my own site to publish my own documents.

This site is for Vietnamese only, no multi-language, so I will speak in Vietnamese from now on ~

## Rào trước

- Các notes ở đây được viết trong tâm trạng thất thường của tôi, ngôn ngữ nửa tây nửa ta, câu từ sai chính tả tùm lum, lộn xộn, lủng củng, lmao, không phù hợp cho trẻ nít bông tuyết hay đàn ông đang cho con bú 🙂
- Việc đưa notes lên đây chỉ là sở thích cá nhân, không nhằm mục đích kinh doanh hay fomo nào.
- Tất cả đều là kiến thức, không có bài nào là xàm. Trust me bro!
- Vì lĩnh vực chính của tôi là IT, nên tất cả chủ đề của cái site này cũng chỉ liên quan tới IT thoy nhé.
- Tailwind rất lỏ. Close topic! Mấy thằng frontend dev biết điều thì nên học CSS cho tử tế vào (và học tý design cho tôi nhờ) 🙂
